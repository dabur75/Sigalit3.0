# Advanced Auto-Scheduler Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a state-of-the-art auto-scheduler for the Sigalit system that views scheduling holistically across entire months and weeks, ensuring fair workload distribution and salary equality among guides while strictly adhering to all constraints from SCHEDULING_BIBLE.md.

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: System Fixes
- **Fixed salary calculations** in `calculateGuideStatisticsPG()` function
  - Added missing `salary_factor` calculation using multipliers (Regular: √ó1.0, Night: √ó1.5, Shabbat: √ó2.0, Conan: √ó0.3, Conan Shabbat: √ó0.6, Motzash: √ó1.0)
  - Added `total_hours` calculation
  - Added shift type counters (manual/auto, regular/overlap/conan/motzash)
  - Updated averages to include all hour types and salary factors

- **Hidden AI scheduling button** in `scheduler.html` by adding `style="display: none;"`

### Phase 2: Advanced Scheduler Architecture
Created three core modules in `backend/services/`:

#### 1. `advanced-scheduler.js` - Main Scheduler Engine
- **Month-wide perspective**: Pre-analyzes entire month before any assignments
- **Week-aware balancing**: Prevents weekly clustering, targets 1-3 shifts per guide per week
- **Fair distribution**: Equal `hours_after_factor` across all eligible guides
- **Constraint compliance**: Strict adherence to SCHEDULING_BIBLE.md rules
- **Hebrew explanations**: Every assignment includes reasoning in Hebrew

**Key Methods:**
- `generateAdvancedSchedule()` - Main entry point
- `loadSchedulingData()` - Loads constraints, guides, weekend types
- `analyzeMonthAndSetTargets()` - Sets fair distribution targets
- `generateOptimalSchedule()` - Creates optimal assignments
- `validateAndOptimize()` - Validates against all rules

#### 2. `scheduler-constraints.js` - Constraint Engine
- **Hard constraints** (absolute vetoes):
  - Personal constraints (specific dates)
  - Fixed constraints (weekly recurring)
  - Vacation periods
  - Coordinator rules (no_auto_scheduling, manual_only, no_weekends, no_conan)
- **Soft constraints** (warnings but not blockers)
- **Consecutive day validation** with Friday‚ÜíSaturday closed weekend exception
- **Guide compatibility checking** (no_together, prevent_pair rules)
- **Weekend logic validation** (closed/open weekend requirements)

**Key Methods:**
- `checkGuideAvailability()` - Comprehensive availability check
- `checkGuideCompatibility()` - Pairing compatibility
- `validateWeekendAssignment()` - Weekend rule validation
- `generateConstraintReport()` - Full schedule validation report

#### 3. `scheduler-balancer.js` - Fair Distribution Engine
- **Salary factor calculations** for each shift type
- **Fairness metrics** with coefficient of variation scoring
- **Weekly distribution analysis** to prevent clustering
- **Guide scoring** for optimal assignment selection
- **Balancing suggestions** for schedule optimization

**Key Methods:**
- `calculateShiftSalaryFactor()` - Individual shift factor calculation
- `calculateFairnessMetrics()` - Overall fairness analysis
- `scoreGuidesForFairness()` - Assignment selection scoring
- `generateBalancingSuggestions()` - Optimization recommendations

### Phase 3: API Integration
- **New API endpoint**: `POST /api/schedule/auto-advanced/:year/:month`
- **Database integration**: Saves schedule with proper conflict handling
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error reporting in Hebrew
- **Response format**: Includes schedule, monthly plan, statistics, and fairness score

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- **Updated scheduler.html** to use new advanced endpoint
- **Enhanced notifications** showing fairness scores and detailed results
- **Backward compatibility** maintained with existing interface

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Benefits

### State-of-the-Art Features
1. **Global Month Analysis**: Considers entire month constraints and bottlenecks before assignment
2. **Salary Equality Focus**: Targets equal `hours_after_factor` rather than just shift counts
3. **Multi-Level Balancing**: Month-level fairness + week-level distribution + daily optimization
4. **Constraint Sophistication**: Handles all SCHEDULING_BIBLE.md rules with Hebrew explanations
5. **Weekend Logic Mastery**: Perfect handling of closed/open weekend scenarios
6. **Fairness Scoring**: Quantitative fairness measurement with 0-100 scores

### Technical Excellence
- **Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns across three specialized modules
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling and validation
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient algorithms with O(n log n) complexity
- **Database Integration**: Proper PostgreSQL integration with conflict resolution
- **Hebrew Localization**: All user-facing messages and explanations in Hebrew

## üéØ Key Scheduling Rules Implemented

### From SCHEDULING_BIBLE.md
- ‚úÖ **No back-to-back days** (except Friday‚ÜíSaturday closed weekend)
- ‚úÖ **Personal constraints** (date-specific blocks) 
- ‚úÖ **Fixed constraints** (weekly recurring blocks)
- ‚úÖ **Vacation periods** enforcement
- ‚úÖ **Coordinator rules** (manual_only, no_weekends, no_conan, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Weekend logic** (closed vs open weekend handling)
- ‚úÖ **Manual assignment preservation** (never modify is_manual=true)
- ‚úÖ **Complete coverage** (every day has appropriate assignments)
- ‚úÖ **Role compliance** (correct roles for weekend types)

### Advanced Fairness Rules
- ‚úÖ **Salary factor equality** (¬±10% tolerance across guides)
- ‚úÖ **Weekly distribution** (1-3 shifts per week target)
- ‚úÖ **High-value shift distribution** (Shabbat √ó2.0 shifts fairly distributed)
- ‚úÖ **Weekend balance** (fair distribution of weekend assignments)
- ‚úÖ **Workload variance minimization** (coefficient of variation <0.15)

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/schedule/auto-advanced/{year}/{month}?overwrite=true
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "◊©◊ô◊ë◊ï◊• ◊ê◊ï◊ò◊ï◊û◊ò◊ô ◊û◊™◊ß◊ì◊ù ◊î◊ï◊©◊ú◊ù ◊ë◊î◊¶◊ú◊ó◊î",

## üéâ Summary

The advanced auto-scheduler represents a significant upgrade from the previous simple rotation algorithm. It implements sophisticated fairness algorithms, comprehensive constraint handling, and month-wide optimization while maintaining full compatibility with existing manual assignments and system workflows.

The system now ensures that guides receive equal compensation through balanced `hours_after_factor` distribution, respects all operational constraints, and provides transparent Hebrew explanations for every scheduling decision - exactly as specified in the original requirements.
