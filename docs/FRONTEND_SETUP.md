# Frontend Setup - Public Only

This project uses a single frontend, served exclusively from `backend/public/`.

- Active source: `backend/public/`
- Archived legacy: `frontend_archive/` (read-only fallback)
- Local dev URL: `http://localhost:4000`

Notes:
- Do not edit or run any server from `frontend/` â€“ that folder was archived.
- All UI work, fixes and assets belong under `backend/public/`.
